 Define a new class, BoardState to be an array of 81 States. The BoardState constructor should receive a const Board* or const Board& parameter and copy the State portion of each of the 81 Squares into the new object.
 Define the subscript function for this class to do the normal thing, no bounds-check needed. -> so sub()?*/
